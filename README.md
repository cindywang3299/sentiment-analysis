# Sentiment Classifier

This classifier predicts the sentiment of phrases found in movie reviews on a scale of being positive (1) or negative (0).

It is trained using a logistic regression model and a convolutional neural network separately to investigate the performance of its accuracy in prediction.

For detailed documentation, visit the [Jupyter Notebook walkthrough](https://github.com/cindywang3299/sentiment-classifier/tree/master/models) and [notes](https://github.com/cindywang3299/sentiment-classifier/tree/master/deliverables) during the development process. The trained weights have been applied using Flask, using a new dataset of movie reviews to validate the training outcomes.

## Datasets
- [IMDB Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
- [Sentiment140](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

## Demo
Here is a quick demo:

Did it guess correctly? Feel free to give feedback to further improve the model!

## Procedures
- Start a virtual environment and install `requirements.txt`
- Build the sentiment classifier
  - The dataset needs to be installed manually:
  ```
  wget http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz
  tar xvzf aclImdb_v1.tar.gz
  ```
  - `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` will then place the dataset under directory `./data/aclImdb` and do all the heavy lifting.
- Write the `app.py` which is the API application that will be deployed
- Update requirements.txt as you write the code
- Test the API

## Testing the model
1. Create a virtual environment called .mais-env:
```
python -m venv .mais-env
```
2. Activate the environment so we are using the fresh, new python environment.

UNIX or MacOS: `source .mais-env/bin/activate`

Windows: `.mais-env\Scripts\activate`

3. Use the requirements.txt file to install all the dependencies in your newly created environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Add a new kernel to Jupyter Notebook:
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name .mais-env --display-name "Python (MAIS-202)"
```
5. Finally, open the `jupyter notebook` of sentiment_analysis.
